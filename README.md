Our objective is to present a proof of concept on two approaches of building a recommendation system. In this notebook, we implement two collaborative filtering algorithms - memory based and model based - and compare the performance of each in terms of accuracy, coverage, and scalability. Lastly, we want to show with conclusive evidence the value of having a recommendation system on our platform.
